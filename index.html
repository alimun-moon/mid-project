            <h1>The Importance Of Interior Design</h1>
            <p>
                Gone are the days when it was thought that <i><b>interior design</b></i> was just a pompous expression for a certain sensitivity and good taste in decorating a space. Something like choosing the right fabrics or colors to use.<br><br>
                Every individual has a dream to own a house for themselves but don’t really ponder interior design to be all that important.  There are people who want to decorate and make their home colorful and this is possible only with help of interior designers. Only interior designers can make a home-interior remarkable as it is their career that gains creativity, technical know-how, professional and industrial skill on space, building, architecture & human lifestyle.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                Interior design not just stands with a look and beauty, added to beauty it also has ability to showcase even a studio apartment as residence which has enough space with the help of proper design and comforting lighting. Whereas, a poor interior design makes a larger house that lack space. Interior designers are experts in creating more spaces, improving the space efficiency, improving the functional usage of space, improving the lighting effect, improving the color effects, improving the textures, patterns, scale, size etc. They are also experts in selecting fittings & equipment. To be precise, it is all about transforming people’s lives and makes their life a better one. Hence interior design is much important than it seem.<br><br>

                Simple fact to hire an interior designer is that they understand the need of the owner and brings their dream home alive. They also can design the house according to vastu (vasthu) or any tradition as per the client’s demand which is an added advantage. Another benefit to have a better interior designed home is that it will fetch higher bids during the sale of the house than any other.<br><br>

                Everyman doesn’t possess a skill to design a home. So it’s wise to hire an interior designer as they are qualified by edification, skill, practice, and examination to enrich utility and quality of interior space. There are worthy reasons to hire an interior designer not only while building a new house but also during a renovation as it ensures that it brings out the exact look and design we wish to have, that makes us a pride owner.<br><br>

                Dream zone understands its importance and hence came up with training an individual to be a designer on interiors. Dream zone school of creative studies provides various courses on interior design that produce many talented interior designers.<br><br>
